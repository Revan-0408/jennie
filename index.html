         Dari semua hal yang bisa bikin aku bahagia, nggak ada yang seindah suara tawamu. Each laugh feels like music, a melody I never want to end.
         In every universe, in every lifetime, I’d still choose your laughter as my favorite song."

         hanya menyisakan senyum kamu di layar itu. Then suddenly, Just You by Teddy Adhitya started to play, and every lyric felt like it was written for us.
         Aku ngerasa begitu beruntung, melihat sosok yang selalu ada di pikiranku. That picture wasn’t just an image,it was the beginning of a memory I’ll never forget"

         The world felt quiet, yet my heart was so full.Every word you said stayed with me, seakan-akan laut sendiri jadi saksi cerita kita. For the first time, I felt truly seen, truly heard.
         Sore itu sederhana,tapi terasa seperti salah satu kenangan terindah. With you, even the ocean whispered love"

         Melihat kamu tertawa dan dikelilingi orang yang sayang sama kamu, made me realize how special you truly are. You blew out the candles with that beautiful smile,
         and in that moment, I silently made my own wish that I could be by your side for every birthday to come."

         kamu selalu ngeluarin suara aneh kaya di sound ini dan itu selalu terus ada di kepalaku, seakan-akan foto itu hidup. It always makes me smile, and somehow fall for you all over again"

         with that sweet smile and said, “It’s me here”. My heart skipped a beat, like the world paused for a second. Sederhana, tapi begitu berkesan,
         karena dari jutaan momen kecil, that one line made me fall for you even deeper."

         Dari semua kebiasaan kecilmu, this one always melts my heart. Even the way you say 'achoo' feels special,a reminder of how cute you are to me."

         Kamu cerita kalau dari kecil udah suka kuda, and in that moment, I loved seeing the childlike joy in your eyes. Before we went home, you took a picture with the horse,
         showing that gummy smile I adore so much. It was simple, yet one of the sweetest memories, a piece of you I’ll always keep close to my heart."

          <h2>For Jennie 💖</h2>
          <p>Since you came into my life, everything I thought I knew about happiness changed. The world felt softer, brighter, and full of meaning—
             all because of you. Kamu adalah kejutan terindah yang pernah aku terima, a blessing I never even knew I was waiting for. I feel so lucky, not just to meet you,
             but to call you mine, and to love you for as long as I live.</p>
